I’m not an expert, but I have to dispute the claim that Covid-19 is a “vaccine-preventable” illness made in a June 14 letter.

Some of my family members were fully vaccinated and boosted and still contracted Covid not once, but twice. I support vaccinations, but they do not prevent infection, though they can mitigate the negative effects of Covid.

Even after vaccination, people can contract Covid, often asymptomatically or with mild symptoms, and transmit it to others.
